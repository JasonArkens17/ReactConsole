# React Console

### Installing Dependencies
From within the root directory:
```sh
npm install
```

### Usage
Run the following command for a static build
```sh
npm start
```

###Moving Forward
1. Figure out how to parse and save entires such as 'functions' or 'variables' to the window or memory so you can call them back once entered in. 

2. DRY out some of the repetitive functionality 

3. Better styling

4. Small arrow icons signifying input and output 

5. Lots more that I cannot think of at the moment...
